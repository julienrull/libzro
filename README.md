# ZrØ - Core Library

**libzro** is a crossplateform boilerplate library for sanity and peaceful mind C programming ✌️
It's also a hub to centralized low level programming concepts I learn. That's
mean these are totaly valid in other languages. C is used here for its
simplicity and ability to stay away from  programmers way to resolve complex
problems.

> It is still in early stage development, so it comes without any guarantee to work properly in a production context. Plus, header files need to be merge together because they depend on eachother. I will add a dependancies tree later. Thank you for your understanding. 

**libzro** is the core fundation of a bigger toolchains project called "ZrØ". It's a personal set of libs for my own usecases first but also for educational purposes. You will find the sources **libzro** is inspired of below. 

## Features

🟠 Doing

🟢 Done

---

- 🟢 **zro_alloc.h**: contextual generic allocator mechanisme. 

- 🟢 **zro_arena.h**: arena allocator, an alternative to malloc for safer and easier memory lifetimes managment. 

- 🟢 **zro_dynarr.h**: dynamic array data structure (aka Vector or ArrayList). 

- 🟠 **zro_string.h**: new string API for easier unicode/UTF-8 compatible strings manimulation and string builder. 

- 🟠 **zro_type.h**: collection of useful type for libzro to work properly. 

- 🔴 **zro_stream.h**: Stream bytes buffer data structures for easier data flow 
  managment. 
  
- 🔴 **zro_socket.h**: socket wrapper for TCP, UDP and custom RAW network transport layers. 

- 🔴 **zro_bgap.h**: Gab buffer implementation for user text manipulation, or in
  other words, the kind of system behind text editors. (rope data structure is a system for more complexe text editor like Microdoft Word).
