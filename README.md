libzro is fundations of a bigger toolchains project called "ZrØ". It's a personal project primarely for my hobby and professional usecases but also for educational purposes, so there is a lot of room for improvement.

## What libzro provides

- **zro_alloc.h**: contextual generic allocator mechanisme.
- **zro_arena.h**: arena allocator, an alternative to malloc for safer and easier memory lifetimes managment.
- **zro_dynarr.h**: dynamic array (aka Vector or ArrayList).
- **zro_string.h**: provide an API for better and easier unicode/UTF-8 compatible strings manimulation.
- **zro_type.h**: crossplatform and clearer type definitions.
